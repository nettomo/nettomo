# nettomo - a bento box for the internet
## currently still in active development!
> Connect with friends (or make new ones) on a free and open-source online platform, without having to go outside and interact in the *real* world.

nettomo is a free and open-source general-purpose do-whatever-you-want sort-of platform. It comes with a bunch of things that lets you adapt the service to your needs and uses. You can use as much or as little of it as you wish, and do all kinds of stuff. As long as you're based online, nettomo could be for you.

- Set up anything from a small announcement board to an entire forum system for you and your pals
- Self-publish your creations like artwork or games
- Communicate and share with others, whether you're a small group of close friends or a worldwide community
- Organise and manage anything from online gaming guilds to irl events
- Collaborate and work together on projects big and small, no matter where you are

For someone who's quite introverted, different online platforms gave me the ability to meet new people and make new friends. I've personally watched so many different things happen during my time online and it's given me an alternative from the stresses and repetition of real life, and if you've spent time on here like I have, you'll probably agree to. Of course, not everything is perfect. There are many people who haven't done great things that I've had to meet online, but at the same time, the people who have helped me grow (and who I have helped grown) has made my time here worth it.

- Thanks to video games, I've been able to connect with others, even just through the meagre in-game chat. With new internet platforms like Discord, Steam and MMORPGs, I've been able to connect with others better-- and eventually lose connection, too. 
- Thanks to internet forums, I've been able to get better at my goals, even just through lurking on the platform. Even just lurking around the old archives of the fxesms Baidu Tieba bar to figure out how to hack my calculator (google translate tysm)
- Thanks to YouTube, I started exploring the net from a very young age and continue to do so to this day, finding new places everyday
  - I've started watching The8BitDrummer on Twitch, his format works *really* well on stream (and he's just a really nice guy)
  - I recently set up a MyAnimeList but actually found myself involved in the community too
- Thanks to open-source software, I've had access to great programs that came about directly as a result of community. I use programs like Chrome, Firefox, Git, Thunderbird, SauceNAO, IQDB and Krita on a almost-daily basis.

I would like to give back to an online community that has given so much to me already. However, realistically a small indie open-source project has no chance against large online networks like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and Discord with hundreds of employees and millions of $$$ in funding, and that's why we're not trying to be one. Our goal is to give upcoming and existing online communinties the infrastructure, userbase and most importantly, the **community!** to grow and expand, and build a community out of the one thing we all share in common: the internet, ofc! If you find nettomo useful, the best thing we can ask you for in return is that you join our community too (and tell others about nettomo).

Ultimately, we've taken a modular but extensible design approach so that you can decide how you make nettomo yours. We want to build it as a coherent and integrated platform that throws away the isolationism so prevalent in online forums, but one that also lets you have the final say. nettomo is a place where you can set up a community from anime to video games to idk (zoology?) or integrate our offerings into your current online space. Our goal isn't to become another big social network or content aggregator, but to sustain other communities and our own, where everyone can feel like they can make a difference. 

Welcome to nettomo - a bento box for the internet!

## FAQ

**Q: Are you a social network? A VoIP platform? Another reddit? What *is* nettomo?**

A: I guess that this concept is pretty unique and relatively unheard of, so I don't know of any singular term for it. But the best idea I've come up with is that nettomo is a üç±bento box for the internet. It comes with different features and elements to create a coherent package for us to use within our online communities, no matter how big or small. We aren't trying to be another space for people online to meetup. Instead, we hope that you find something useful on nettomo that encourages you to expand beyond whatever limitations your current platform has, whether it's a Discord server or a self-hosted phpBB instance.

**Q: How much does nettomo cost to use?**

A: 100% free and non-profit, always. If we ever decide to collect money, it'll go back into the project.
