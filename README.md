# nettomo - a bento box for the internet 🍱
### Currently under active development (as of 11 Jul 2020)
> Connect with friends (or make new ones) on a free and open-source communication platform, without having to go outside and interact in the *real* world.

nettomo is a free and open-source general-purpose communication platform for anyone online. Whether you're an individual looking for a place to promote your art or you run an existing online community that needs some extra space, nettomo comes with a bunch of things that lets you adapt the platform to your needs and uses, even if you already use existing apps. 

- Set up anything from a small announcement board to an entire forum system for you and your pals
- Self-publish your creations like artwork or games
- Communicate and share with others in awesome IRC-style text chat, whether you're a small group of close friends or a worldwide community
- Organise and manage anything from online gaming guilds to irl events
- Collaborate and work together on projects big and small, no matter where you are
- Make nettomo yours and use as much or as little of it as you want
